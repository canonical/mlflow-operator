## Supported Versions

The Charmed MLflow project releases with a cadence of ~6 months, supports two minor versions of MLflow, and keeps up to date with the latest upstream version. Whenever a new version of Charmed MLflow is released, the oldest version is dropped from support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
