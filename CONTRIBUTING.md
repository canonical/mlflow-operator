## How to Manage Python Dependencies and Environments

`tox` is the only tool required locally, as `tox` internally installs and uses `poetry`, be it to manage Python dependencies or to run `tox` environments. Optionally, `poerty` can be additionally installed independently just for the sake of running Python commands locally outside of `tox` during debugging/development. Refer to the respective official docs for [installing poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and [installing tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/installation.html).


### Updating Dependencies

To add/update/remove any dependencies and/or to upgrade Python, simply:

1. add/update/remove such dependencies to/in/from the desired group(s) below `[tool.poetry.group.<your-group>.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`, and/or upgrade Python itself in `requires-python` under `[project]`

    _⚠️ dependencies for the charm itself are also defined as dependencies of a dedicated group called `charm`, specifically below `[tool.poetry.group.charm.dependencies]`, and not as project dependencies below `[project.dependencies]` or `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` ⚠️_

2. run `tox -e update-requirements` to update the lock file

    by this point, `poerty`, through `tox`, will let you know if there are any dependency conflicts to solve.

3. optionally, if you also want to update your local environment for running Python commands/scripts yourself and not through tox, see [Running Python Environments](#running-python-environments) below


### Running `tox` Environments

To run `tox` environments locally, ensure to have `tox` installed first and then simply run your `tox` environments natively (e.g.: `tox -e lint`). `tox` will internally first install `poetry` and then rely on it to install and run its environments.


### Running Python Environments

To run Python commands locally from any environments built from any combinations of dependency groups without relying on `tox`:
1. ensure you have `poetry` installed
2. install any required dependency groups: `poetry install --only <your-group-a>,<your-group-b>` (or all groups, if you prefer: `poetry install --all-groups`)
3. run Python commands via poetry: `poetry run python3 <your-command>`
