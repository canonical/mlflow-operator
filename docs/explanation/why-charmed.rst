Why choose charmed MLflow?
==========================

Are you considering using Charmed MLflow? Wondering what the advantages are of charmed MLflow vs. upstream `MLflow`_?

Knowing the answer to this will help any prospective MLflow users decide whether they want the charmed version.

Simplified deployment, upgrades, and updates
--------------------------------------------

Charmed MLFlow offers simplified deployment, upgrade guides, and the latest updates.

Like any charmed product, Charmed MLflow is deployed as a `charm bundle <https://juju.is/docs/juju/bundle>`_ using `Juju <https://juju.is/>`. Deploying an application with Juju is arguably simpler than deploying to a raw Kubernetes cluster.

Security, stability, and maintenance
-------------------------------------

Charmed MLFlow benefits from the following:

- Automated security scanning: The bundle is scanned periodically.
- Security patching: Charmed MLFlow follows Canonicalâ€™s process and procedure for security patching. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity, the presence of patches in the upstream project, and the risk of exploitability.
- Maintained images: All Charmed MLFlow images are actively maintained.
- Comprehensive testing: Charmed MLFlow is thoroughly tested on multiple platforms, including public cloud, local workstations, on-premises deployments, and various CNCF-compliant Kubernetes distributions.
