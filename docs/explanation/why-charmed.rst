==========================

TODO: Figure out what we're saying here

Are you considering using Charmed MLflow `MLflow`_? Wondering what the advantages are of charmed `MLflow`_ vs. the upstream version?

Knowing the answer to this will help any prospective MLflow users decide whether they want the charmed version.

Simplified Deployment, Upgrades, and Updates
--------------------------------------------

Charmed MLFlow offers simplified deployment, upgrade guides, and the latest updates.

Like any charmed product, Charmed MLflow is deployed as a `charm bundle <https://juju.is/docs/juju/bundle>`_ using `Juju <https://juju.is/>`. Deploying an application with Juju is arguably simpler than deploying to a raw Kubernetes cluster.

Security, Stability, and Maintenance
-------------------------------------

Charmed MLFlow benefits from the following:

- Automated security scanning: The bundle is scanned periodically (e.g., every [x] days), and scan results can be observed [here](link-to-scan-results).
- Security patching: Charmed MLFlow follows Canonical’s process and procedure for security patching. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity, the presence of patches in the upstream project, and the risk of exploitability.
- Maintained images: All Charmed MLFlow images are actively maintained.
- Comprehensive testing: Charmed MLFlow is thoroughly tested on multiple platforms, including public cloud, local workstations, on-premises deployments, and various CNCF-compliant Kubernetes distributions.
