# MLflow Operators

## Introduction

Charmed MLflow is a full set of Kubernetes operators to deliver the [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), for easy operations anywhere, from workstations to on-prem, to public cloud and edge.

A charm is a software package that includes an operator together with metadata that supports the
integration of many operators in a coherent aggregated system.

This technology leverages the Juju Operator Lifecycle Manager to provide day-0 to day-2 operations
of Kubeflow.
