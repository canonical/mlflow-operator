      Provides advanced ingress routing with support for multiple ports and protocols
      (HTTP, gRPC) using typed configuration models. Requirers can define custom
      Gateway listeners and routes. If the ingress has authentication configured,
      all routes will have authentication applied to them.

      Allow a cross-model application access to catalogue via the service mesh.
      This relation provides additional data required by the service mesh to enforce
      cross-model authorization policies.
      If this app relates to other applications on a charmed service mesh cross-model,
      use this relation to send that related app additional data needed to automatically
      generate traffic authorization policies. This is required because Juju does not
      natively provide all information required to build these policies when related
      cross-model.

      Access a cross-model application from catalogue via the service mesh.
      This relation provides additional data required by the service mesh to enforce
      cross-model authorization policies.
      If this app is generating policies to provide access to related applications that
      are cross-model, relate that app to this additional relation to retrieve additional
      data required for these policies. This is required because Juju does not natively
      provide all information required to build these policies when related cross-model.
